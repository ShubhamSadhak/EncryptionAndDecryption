Encryption And Decryption using XOR Funtion:-

XOR (Exclusive OR) encryption is a simple symmetric key encryption technique where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It uses the bitwise XOR operation between the plaintext and the key.

In this method, each character (or byte) of the plaintext is XORed with a key character to produce the ciphertext. To decrypt, the ciphertext is XORed with the same key to retrieve the original plaintext.
